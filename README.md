My project entails a web program written in Javascript, HTML and CSS, about nutritional needs. 

Food and nutriton has always played an important role in my life. Seeing what it can do for a person’s health, for myself and people around me. 
I have seen people’s life change who were not very healthy before or even terminally ill. My goal with this project was to make more people aware of their current health and help them have an indication about how many calories they should consume in a day, and how these calories should look like in terms of food. 

First I implemented a couple of calculators, where the user can input their characteristics such as height, weight and age. These calculators will then display the user's BMR, BMI and body fat percentage (each on different navigation pages of the program). The program will display how many calories the user should consume on a daily basis based on their characteristics and activity level, and indicate how many calories could be consumed daily (without gaining weight) when exercise is completely eliminated. 

When calculating BMI, the user should receive an index accompanied by a table that shows in which range this index falls (whether it is a health index). 
Based on the user's characteristics, he can verify how much he should weigh approximately according to what is considered a healthy weight in the healthy BMI range. Finally, risks associated with being overweight or underweight are mentioned. 

The last calculator displays the user's body fat percentage, a table that shows the different ranges of body fat for men and women that are considered essential, healthy or obese, and also the risks associated with having excess body fat. Finally, the user can also calculate how much fat mass he should loose based on their input (desired body fat percentage).

Now, with this knowledge the user has an indication of their current state of health. If they feel good on a daily basis (are not sick), are not overweight, have a healthy BMI, etc. it is advised to pretty much keep doing what you are doing. However, when this is not the case, a change could / should be made. A lot of people consume too many calories on a daily basis, i.e. more than they can burn off, causing them to end up with a BMI and body fat percentage that is too high. 
At the same time, a lot of people have no idea how many calories are inside the foods they eat. For this reason, the program contains a meal plan calculator, where the user should enter his total daily calorie needs (calculated in the BMR calculator), choose a meal for breakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack, whereafter a detailed meal plan is presented. In this mealplan, the user is able to read all ingredients and quantities of these ingredients per meal, accompanied by the calories, carbs, fat and protein contents per ingredient.
