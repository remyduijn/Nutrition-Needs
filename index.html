        <h1 class="title">Nutrition Needs</h1>
        
        <p id="text">The effective management of food intake and nutrition are both key to good health. Smart nutrition and food choices can help prevent disease, and eating the right foods can 
        help your body cope more successfully with an ongoing illness. 
        Food provides us with the energy and nutrients we need to stay healthy. Men and women need protein, carbohydrates, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals and water. These things may help prevent 
        some diseases, including osteoporosis, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. Another important factor, apart from eating the right foods, is the amount of calories 
        we consume. According to several studies, among which the Okinawa centenarian study, calorie restriction is one of the most effective ways to add years of life. Experiments with mice as well as
        studies in the Blue Zones (identified areas with many cases of high age) have shown that maintaining a bit of appetite prolongs the bodyâ€™s youthfulness. If the body always gets enough or even 
        too many calories, it gets lethargic and deteriorates, while it spends a lot of energy on the digestion of food.
